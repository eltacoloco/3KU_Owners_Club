[printer]
kinematics: delta
#   This option must be "delta" for linear delta printers.
max_velocity: 300
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_accel: 1000
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead relative to the
#   print. This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 150
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
#minimum_z_position: 0.00
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to.  The default is 0.
delta_radius: 108.2
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three linear
#   axis towers. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#    delta_radius = smooth_rod_offset - effector_offset - carriage_offset
#   This parameter must be provided.

# The delta_calibrate section enables a DELTA_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that can calibrate the tower endstop positions and
# angles.
[delta_calibrate]
radius: 100
#   Radius (in mm) of the area that may be probed. This is the radius
#   of nozzle coordinates to be probed; if using an automatic probe
#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
# samples: 2
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to retract between each sample if sampling
#   more than once. The default is 2mm.


[probe]
pin: ^!ar18
#   Probe detection pin. This parameter must be provided.
#x_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
#y_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.
z_offset: 0.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute prior to each probe attempt. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) to execute after each probe attempt completes. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

# Heater and temperature sensor verification. Heater verification is
# automatically enabled for each heater that is configured on the
# printer. Use verify_heater sections to change the default settings.
[verify_heater heater_bed]
#heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by when approaching a new target temperature. The default is 2.
check_gain_time: 1200
#   The amount of time (in seconds) that the heating_gain must be met
#   in before an error is raised. The default is 20 seconds for
#   extruders and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
#hysteresis: 5
#   The difference between the target temperature and the current
#   temperature for the heater to be considered within range of the
#   target temperature. The default is 5.
#max_error: 120
#   The maximum temperature difference a heater that falls outside the
#   target temperature range may accumulate before an error is
#   raised. For example, if the target temperature is 200, the
#   hysteresis is 5, the max_error is 120, and the temperature is
#   reported at 185 degrees for 12 seconds then an error would be
#   raised (or 24 seconds at 190, or 120 seconds at 194, etc.). The
#   default is 120.
