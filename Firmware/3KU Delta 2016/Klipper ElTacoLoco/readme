This is a copy of my klipper config mostly for reference, I don't recomend using this config without making changes to work for your printer. 

# My Printer:
3ku Delta 2016
Heated bed
Arduino ATMEGA2560 + RAMP 1.4
Stepper driver: A4988
OPTICAL ENDSTOP
Nozzle 0.8mm
Filament diameter 1.75
Glass bed
No autocalibration only manual calibration



- The endstop_pin are inverted to work with my Optical Endstops 
- adjusted position_endstop by doing paper test, to compensate for diferent height of the axis on my printer
- auto bed level function is not tested so might need some adjustment 
- Added START and END gcode in config file so the only GCODE that is needed in the slicer is for the Start G-Code: "START_PRINT" and for the End G-Code: "END_PRINT"
- heater_pin for the Heated Bed is corrected to work with my printer modell
- for the "serial:" you have to find out what the correct value is for your printer when it's plugged in.
